# Masterproject

The advancing automation and digitalization of industrial production processes is leading to increasing demands for inline quality controls. This can ensure early detection of defects and the sorting out of faulty products. With the increasing number and diversity of 
components to be inspected, there is a growing need for reliable, scalable and automated methods for detecting various anomalies. As many defects manifest themselves through visible changes to the surface or structure of components, image processing plays a central role
in quality assurance. By integrating artificial intelligence (AI) methods in particular, even the smallest deviations can be detected in real time, thereby significantly reducing the error rate. 

This master's project examines various approaches to visual anomaly detection in the industrial manufacturing environment. One focus is on the systematic comparison of modern, high-performance one-class models and vision language models (VLMs). The aim of the project is 
to analyze the respective strengths, weaknesses and application potentials of both approaches in a well-founded manner and to derive practice-relevant findings.


Using the 'pipeline':
1. Train and test a choosen one-class model with train_and_test_cli.py
2. Train and test AnomalyCLIP with train.py and test_vlm.py
3. Use metrics.py and VisualizeResults.py to create final results for analysis


The master's project was conducted at the Institut f√ºr datenoptimierte Fertigung (IDF) in Kaufbeuren as part of the 'Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision' master's course at the University of Applied Sciences Kempten.
